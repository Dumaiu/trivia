** Complete Set of Specialized Vector Patterns

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
<vector-pattern> : vector      | simple-vector
                   bit-vector  | simple-bit-vector
                   string      | simple-string
                   base-string | simple-base-string | sequence 
(<vector-pattern> &rest subpatterns)
#+END_SRC

The family of vector-patterns also have /soft-match/ variants like
=vector*=, which matches against the vectors with insufficient number of
elements, binding the remaining unmatched variables with NIL.

** Access Pattern

Just want to access an element? It's time to use =access= pattern: 

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(access #'accessor subpattern) ; or
(access 'accessor subpattern)
#+END_SRC

These expand into 

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-gensyms (it)
  `(guard1 ,it t (,accessor ,it) ,subpattern))
#+END_SRC
