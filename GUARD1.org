Normal syntax of guard1:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(guard1 symbol test-form {generator-form subpattern}*)
#+END_SRC

Extended syntax of guard1:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(guard1 (symbol &key (type t) place (ignorable (symbol-package symbol)) &allow-other-keys)
        test-form {generator-form subpattern}*)
#+END_SRC

- type :: a type specifier. It is added to the declaration after =let=.
- place :: if this key is non-nil, then the symbol is bound with
           symbol-macrolet and the accessor becomes setf-able.
- ignorable :: If non-nil, =symbol= is declared to be =ignorable=, and is
               not accounted for or1 pattern consistency check. Default
               value is =T= when =symbol= is a non-interned symbol, and
               =NIL= otherwise.
